# Week 1 Assignment - That Portfolio Though

### Overview
In this assignment, I built a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS and the below specification guide.

### Specifcations

1. Colors _Pro-tip: Use the [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages._

   * Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): `#4aaaa5`
   * Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): `#777777`
   * Main header background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main header border color: `#cccccc`
   * Footer background color: `#666666`
   * Main content background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main content border color: `#dddddd`

2. Fonts:

   * For heading fonts use `font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;`.
   * For all other fonts use `'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;`.

3. Profile Image Found on `index.html`:

   * Use a picture of yourself. 
   * If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

4. Portfolio Images:

   * Placeholder images can be found at [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). 
   * Save the images to your `images` folder.

5. Social Link Images (Github, LinkedIn,  StackOverflow, etc.):

   * These images can be found on [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/).
   * Save the images to your `images` folder.
   * Ensure that these icons are live links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles.

6. Background Images:

   * The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

7. Dimensions:
   * The entire content area is `960px` wide.
   * The main section content is `650px` wide.
   * The sidebar is `270px` wide.
   * Pro-tip: Use the [Page Ruler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn/related?hl=en) extension to measure the size of elements.
